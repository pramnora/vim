## Vim, Linux text editor  

In order to launch Vim text editor inside of Linux...; then, simply, type:  

> vim  

...the Vim text editor will open. At first, you will find yourself in 'command mode'...;    
where you will not be able to enter any text.  

In order to enter text type:  

>i  

...which, now, puts you in 'insert mode'; where you can begin typing in keyboard characters.   
Pressing the [Enter] key will take you to the next line downwards.  

When you are finished typing in...; and, wish to save the file you have typed in...;    
then, press the [ESC] key...; this will put you back into 'command mode'.  

>:wq fileName  

...will both (w)rite the file/and, also, (q)uit from out of the editor.  

Another way to open Vim editor is...by giving it a fileName to begin with...; by using:  

>vim fileName  

...so, now, when you wish to quit; you just simply use...without any fileName...  

>:wq
